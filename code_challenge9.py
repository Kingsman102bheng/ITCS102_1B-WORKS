# Create a fun program that acts like a parrot — it repeats anything the user says, using a for loop to "squawk" it back multiple times!

# This challenge focuses purely on:
# Using a simple for loop
# Working with strings
# Repeating an action without storing data
# Ask the user to enter a phrase (e.g., "I love Python!").Ask how many times they want the parrot to repeat it.Use a for loop to print the phrase that many times.Make each line sound like a parrot: " Squawk! {phrase}"   

# Copy this bitmap image -> 

# 🦜

# Expected output 🦜 PARROT SIMULATOR – THE ECHO CHAMBER!What do you want your parrot to say? I am hungry!
# How many times should the parrot squawk it? 4

# Listen to your parrot:
# 🦜 Squawk! I am hungry!
# 🦜 Squawk! I am hungry!
# 🦜 Squawk! I am hungry!
# 🦜 Squawk! I am hungry!
